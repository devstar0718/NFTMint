# NFTMint

This is test project for NFT Minter which contains 3 projects - frontend, backend and smart contract

I tested with rinkeby testnet of ethereum and opensea testnet and current frontend code includes deployed smart contract address and backend api url.

### For testing yourself

1. run the backend(including database - mysql) on the hosting(ngrok can be used if no server)
2. deploy the smart contract with the url of backend
3. change contract address and backend api on the frontend code and run the frontend of website


## Run Frontend

In the project Frontend directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
